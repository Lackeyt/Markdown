# Sushi Delivery During Quarantine

Food delivery services have been a life saver during quarantine, removing the need for stressful visits to the grocery store from the weekly schedule. 

## Delivery Options
* [Postmates](https://postmates.com/)
* [Grubhub](https://www.grubhub.com/)
* [Doordash](https://www.doordash.com/en-US)

While these are the standards for food delivery in my area, many restaurants have started offering delivery or pickup options directly through websites. 

### Endless Food Choices
Your imagination is really the limit of what you can get without the stress of cooking or prep work. Seafood is always a risky option at restaurants, especially when considering delivery and handling. However, with the efficiency of these services and the quality of the restaurants in Portland,  I have found myself falling back on _Sushi_ as my go-to option for a lazy meal when shopping is out of the question.
